42 Istanbul Software School Experience
During the intensive 26-day training period, I acquired over 300 hours of education in Shell and C programming languages, enhancing my technical skills. Throughout this process, I focused on gaining in-depth knowledge in areas such as pointers, memory management, argument usage, git, and GitHub.

Restrictions and Professional Development
Due to restrictions on using certain libraries during this training, I honed my ability to produce solutions with only fundamental skills. This limitation allowed me to concentrate on foundational skills, strengthening my core capabilities.

Projects and Work
During this time, I worked on and shared code related to the following topics:

Pointers and Memory Management:
Argument Usage:
Git and GitHub: 
Use with Shell:

Artificial Intelligence-Controlled Exams
Exams included challenging tasks controlled by artificial intelligence on a minute-by-minute basis. I share the knowledge gained and achievements on GitHub.

Step Towards Goals
This experience has been a significant step toward my career goals. In the upcoming processes, I aim to specialize in data-related work. This period solidified my algorithmic foundation, providing a robust base for future projects.
