Hello ðŸ‘‹ 42 Istanbul & 42 Kocaeli Software School Experience During the 26-day intensive training period, I developed my technical skills by taking over 300 hours of training in Shell and C programming languages. During this process, I focused on gaining in-depth knowledge in areas such as pointers, memory management, argument usage, git and GitHub.

Constraints and Professional Development:
Due to the restrictions on using certain libraries during this training, I improved my ability to create solutions with only basic skills. This limitation allowed me to focus on basic skills and strengthen my core abilities.

Projects and Work During this time I worked on and shared code related to the following topics:

Pointers and Memory Management: Argument Usage: Git and GitHub: Shell Usage : 

Artificial Intelligence Controlled Exams: The exams included challenging tasks controlled by artificial intelligence on a minute-by-minute basis. I share my knowledge and achievements on GitHub.

Step Towards My Goals: This experience was an important step towards my career goals. I aim to specialise in data-related work in the future. This period strengthened my algorithmic foundation and created a solid foundation for future projects.
